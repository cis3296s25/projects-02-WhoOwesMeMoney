# Who Owes Me Money
The purpose of this app is to track how much someone owes you. Why canâ€™t you just use a sheet of paper or your notes app on your phone, you ask?
This app is different from just pen and paper in that it can scan the receipt and pick out the item and their totals and assign them to the people that had them.
For example me and two friends go out, they order a steak, a hamburger, and a soup.
I can assign my friends the item they had and it will give me the total the owe plus tip and tax! This will work even if they had multiple items and the nice part is that you can keep a running tab of the total they owe you so you never forget.
